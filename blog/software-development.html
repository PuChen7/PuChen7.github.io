            <h>Agile and Scrum</h><br>
            <text><b>Scrum</b></text> is a (incremental and iterative) framework that is used to implement Agile development.<br>
            <b>Key Concepts:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In Scrum, every event has a maximum duration.</li>
                <li><b>Sprint</b> - the heart of Scrum
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sprint is a time-box of potentially releasible product increment is created. A new Sprint starts immediately after the previous one.</li>
                        <li>Sprint consists of:
                            <ul>
                                <li><mark>Sprint planning</mark>: the work to be performed</li>
                                <li><mark>Daily Scrum meeting</mark>: meeting for team to synchronize the activities and create new plan</li>
                                <li><mark>Sprint review</mark>: held at the end of Sprint to inspect the quality of the product</li>
                                <li><mark>Sprint retrospective</mark>: occur after the Sprint review and before the next Sprint planning. plan improvements</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Scrum team
                            <ul>
                                <li>Scrum Master: making process run smoothly and organize</li>
                                <li>Product Owner: maximize the value of the product and the work of the team. Key role to manage the backlog.</li>
                                <li>Team: self-organizing and cross-functional. Consists of designer, developer, testers etc. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Backlog</b>: The Backlog is where you list out everything the project needs, ordered by importance. Keep in mind that the Backlog is never complete. As the project takes shape and new needs emerge, you will add to this. The Product Owner takes primarily responsible for this.</li>
                <li><b>Overall</b>: In the SCRUM methodology a sprint is the basic unit of development. Each sprint starts with a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made. A Sprint ends with a review or retrospective meeting where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product.</li>
            </ul>
