            <h>General Introduction to GUI</h><br>
            <b>Important about GUI design</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Not just think as user, you need to imagine what your users are like. How would they use the feature? etc.</li>
                <li>Walk the user through the GUI. Put yourself in user's position</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Good UI should be:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Attractive</li>
                <li>Simple to use</li>
                <li>Responsive in short time</li>
                <li>Clear to understand</li>
                <li>Consistent on all interfacing screens</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

                <li><text>GUI Requirement Gathering</text>: Taken from users.</li>
                <li><text>User Analysis</text>: Who is going to use the software? Technical savvy? Novice user?</li>
                <li><text>Task Analysis</text>: what tasks need to be done?</li>
                <li><text>GUI Design & implementation</text>: design and implement the GUI</li>
                <li><text>Test</text>: involvement of users and release of beta version are few of them. Testing may include usability, compatibility, user acceptance etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>User Interface Golden rules</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li><text>Consistency</text>: e.g. a certain style of button should always do the same thing.</li>
                <li><text>Informative feedback</text>: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on. e.g. installation status</li>
                <li><text>Permit easy reversal of actions</text></li>
                <li><text>Error handling</text></li>

                <h>HTML Concepts</h><br>
                <b>What is HTML: </b>Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
                <text><b>DOCTYPE</b></text>: an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. It should be the very first thing in an HTML document.<br><br>
                <text><b>Differences Between SVG and Canvas</b></text>
                <ul>
                    <li>SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.</li>
                    <li>Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).</li>
                    <li>SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.</li>
                    <li>In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.</li>
                    <li>Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.</li>
                </ul>
