           <h1>Hi, I'm Pu Chen</h1>
           <div id="text">
                I'm a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers University, New Brunswick</a>.
                <br>I'm currently living in New Jersey and looking for my next software development job.

                <br><br>
                I was born in Beijing, China and I came to the United States in Jan. 2014.
                <br>
                I love exploring new lifestyle and challenges and this is the reason why I chose to go abroad.
                <br>
                Basketball is my favorite sport. I played point guard for both my middle school and high school.

                <br><br>
                I love making new friends and sharing thoughts with different people. 
                <br>You can always reach me through my email <u id="highlight">puchen8295@gmail.com</u>
                or you can get to know me by checking out my repos at <a id="text" href="https://github.com/PuChen7">my GitHub page.</a>
